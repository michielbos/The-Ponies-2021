Should we have a baby?

Don't forget to check on your baby's needs. As a responsible parent, you must make sure they are well-fed, clean, socialized with, and have a comfy place to sleep.

Shame on you! The baby is being neglected. Make sure the baby gets enough food and sleep or somepony from social services may relieve you of your parental duties.

You've blown it! Your child needs proper care, and they sure won't find that in this house. A social worker is coming to take them away.
